# subOS
Main repository for the components of subOS, an operating system built by
Subnodal.

Licenced by the [Subnodal Open-Source Licence](LICENCE.md).

## Specifications
The development of subOS will be done in accordance to the subOS Redesign
Proposal, which is
[viewable at the Subnodal website](https://subnodal.com/media/subOSProposal.pdf).
Specifically, refer to the _Project roadmap_ section to learn about the
development process of subOS, in addition to the _Ensuring that everybody can
get involved_ section to learn how to contribute to the subOS project.

## Contributing
Opportunities for contributing to the subOS codebase are currently quite
limited. We plan to expand our opportunities later on in development once we've
implemented the basic functionality of subOS. In the meantime, feel free to
submit issues to this repository with the **enhancement** label to suggest
changes.

We currently have no RFC process and so we do not currently have a method for
making any new feature requests official.
