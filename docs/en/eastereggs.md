# Easter eggs 🐇🥚
**SPOILER ALERT!** If you're still hunting for Easter eggs, don't look here!
This document serves as a directory for Easter eggs hidden in and around subOS.
However, if you want to see what Easter eggs we've hidden, you're in the right
place!

## Easter egg policy
1. We're not Microsoft, so you are allowed have fun here.
2. Don't put _too_ many Easter eggs into subOS, or people will think you're mad,
   and some may regard us as unprofessional.
3. Easter eggs must be well-hidden and not easy to come across. We want people
   to enjoy the challenge of finding an Easter egg, and we don't want normal
   users commonly stumbling across them and thinking that we're all mad!
4. Easter eggs should not disrupt the use of subOS, nor should it make us have
   to spend hours figuring out why something won't work because of one stupid
   little joke...

## Directory of Easter eggs
(Sorted by time created, newest last)
* [/docs/en/users.md](/docs/en/users.md): Subnodal likes to be inclusive, which
  means that we should accept "pets or inanimate objects" as users, and not just
  humans!
  > ...we like to follow the concept of _one human per user_ in that users
  > should be easily identifiable as to who they are. (Don't worry though, that
  > doesn't limit you to creating users for your pets or inanimate objects,
  > too!)
* [/packages/test.js](/packages/test.js): The namespace identifier which we use
  to test the condition where an identifier is too long is:

  ```
  com.example.idjustliketointerjectforamomentwhatyourereferringtoaslinuxisinfactgnuslashlinuxorasiverecentlytakentocallingitgnupluslinux
  ```

  For those who are struggling to read that, it's a reference to the rather
  infamous
  [_Interjection Copypasta_](https://wiki.installgentoo.com/wiki/Interjection)
  ─ a fictional quote attributed to Richard
  Stallman, the author of the GPL licence and founder of the GNU project:
  > I'd just like to interject for a moment.  What you're referring to as Linux,
  > is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus
  > Linux...
